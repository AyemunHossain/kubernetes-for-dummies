# üîß Service vs Ingress in Kubernetes

| Aspect                  | Service                                           | Ingress                                                       |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**             | Exposes a set of Pods internally or externally    | Manages external access (HTTP/S) to Services                  |
| **Level**               | Network abstraction for Pods                      | Application-layer (Layer 7) routing                           |
| **Protocols**           | Works with any protocol (TCP/UDP)                 | Works mostly with HTTP and HTTPS                              |
| **Common Types**        | ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer                 | Ingress object + Ingress Controller                           |
| **Use case**            | Stable IP for a group of Pods (e.g., app service) | Routes based on domain, path (e.g., /api ‚Üí service A)         |
| **Need a controller?**  | No                                                | Yes ‚Äî needs an Ingress Controller (like NGINX, Traefik, etc.) |
| **Can do TLS (HTTPS)?** | Only with external configuration                  | Yes, natively via annotations and certs                       |

### üõ†Ô∏è Example:

### You want to expose your app to users via browser at https://myapp.com:

- Service will expose your app Pod(s) internally (ClusterIP) or externally (LoadBalancer).
- Ingress will route incoming traffic on myapp.com to the right Service, with HTTPS support and path/domain-based routing.

### You want internal communication between microservices:

- You only need Service (ClusterIP) ‚Äî no Ingress needed.
